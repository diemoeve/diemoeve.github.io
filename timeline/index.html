October 2025 🎃Hack The Boo CTF 2025 Participated in HackTheBox’s Halloween-themed CTF. Completed challenges in Crypto, Pwn, and Reversing categories.

The last challenge didn’t make sense at all and I refused to accept a bruteforce approach that I eventually took.. 2025 🔐Started Security Research Began focusing on CTF competitions and security research. Started documenting writeups to share knowledge with the community. June 2025 👥Hack The System CTF 2025 Hack The System CTF – Top 10 / 1,323. Here I built a 3-person team and we were able to secure the top 10. The best achievement for everyone at this point. This is how Legendary Queue CTF Team came to life. The philosophy: just a “queue”. Anyone can be there depending on the availability. We don’t force anything, no special meetings. In fact our chat may seem dead. But when an interesting CTF comes by we gather and play together as a great team! 2021 📚Hacking Books Maybe from movies.. maybe from YT videos but I understood that hacking is legit. So I got a bunch of books that screamed ‘Hacking for Beginners’ or ‘Hacking Guide!’ and just read all of it during school breaks understanding 20% of the content, but feeling just great! 2020 🐍Python Chapter Discovered Python. Don’t remember the exact motive, but I ended up skipping a lot of school just to create bots. Bots for everything. Spotify, Instagram, TikTok.. (engagement bot farms). I did music at that time and after learning that all top artists have crazy botting to get into charts wanted to do the same. Later offered that as a service and at the end published the source code to GitHub, being the first full OSS project for Spotify with GUI automation. 2019 💻Web Development Era Discovered a Udemy course on web development on my dad’s account and started doing it. Had time-limited access to a laptop at that time. Remember how I went on a trip and wrote HTML code in my phone notes app. That’s how obsessed I was. Created a very basic HTML &#43; CSS about page. 7 years old :) 🌱The Beginning? Got my tablet. Android 4.x? Of course with parental control. I couldn’t stand it. All kids were playing Minecraft and I was stuck with chess - what I was allowed. Well I got pretty good at chess and even won 2nd place at a competition BUT no way I stay locked. I already went through all the settings in the system and every app (that was genuinely curious) at some point (I don’t remember how ofc) managed to escape the sandboxed user and landed in the admin panel. There I could reset the password and now I had full access to Play Market! However.. after some time I felt guilty and told my dad about it. He changed something and yet it was a new challenge again. The old trick didn’t work, I found a new one! Through the WeatherApp you could open the about page and then through it open other URLs, so I got access to YouTube. This was a long cycle of breaking the controls and telling my parents about it until I got to the age of 16 I think, when they told me I am grown up now and should be responsible for my decisions.">
