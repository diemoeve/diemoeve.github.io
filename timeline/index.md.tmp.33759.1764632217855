{{< event title="Hack The Boo CTF 2025" date="October 2025" icon="🎃" >}}
Participated in HackTheBox's Halloween-themed CTF.
Completed challenges in Crypto, Pwn, and Reversing categories.
Here I competed for over 16h and finally was able to secure top 5! It was a win and a nightmare. The last challenge didn't make sense at all and I refused to accept a bruteforce approach that I eventually took..

{{< event title="Hack The System CTF 2025" date="June 2025" icon="👥" >}}
Hack The System CTF – Top 10 / 1,323. Here I built a 3-person team and we were able to secure the top 10. The best achievement for everyone at this point. This is how Legendary Queue CTF Team came to life. The philosophy: just a "queue". Anyone can be there depending on the availability. We don't force anything, no special meetings. In fact our chat may seem dead. But when an interesting CTF comes by we gather and play together as a great team!

{{< event title="Hacking Books" date="2021">}}
Maybe from movies.. maybe from YT videos but I understood that hacking is legit. So I got bunch of books that screamed 'Hacking for Beginners' or 'Hacking Guide!' and just read all of it during school breaks understanding 20% of the content, but feeling just great!

{{< event title="Python Chapter" date="2020">}}
Discovered python. Don't remember the exact motiv, but I ended up scipping a lot of school just to create bots. Bots for everything. Spotify, Instagram, TikTok.. (engagement bot farms). I did music at that time and after learing that all top artist have crazy botting to get into charts wanted to do the same. Later offered that as service and at the end publshed the source code to github, being the first full OSS project for Spotify with the GUI automation.

{{< event title="The Beginning?" date="2019">}}
Discovered Udemy course on webdevelopment on my dad's account and started doing it. Had time limited access to laptop at that time. Remember how I went on a trip and wrote HTML code in my phone notes app. That's how obsessed I was. Created very basic html + css about page.

{{< event title="The Beginning?" date="7 years old :)">}}
Got my Tablet. Android 4.x? Of course with parental control. I couldn't stand it. All kids were playing minecraft and I stuck with chess - what I was allowed. Well I got pretty good at chess and even won 2nd place at a competition BUT no way I stay locked. I already went through all the settings in the system and every app (that was geniuly courious) at some point (I don't remember how ofc) managed to escape the sandboxed user and landed in the admin panel. There could reset the password and now I had full access to play market! However.. after some time I felt guilty and talled my dad about it. He changed something and yet it was a new challenge again. The old trick didn't work, I found new one! Through the WeatherApp you could open the about page and then trough it open other urls, so I got access to YouTube. This was a long cycle of breaking the controls and telling my parents about it until I got to the age of 16 I think, when they talled me I am grown up now and should responsible for my desissions.
